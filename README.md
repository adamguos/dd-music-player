Digital Design Design Cycle project - Year 11 Semester 2

A music player written in Python to play back local music files and stream music from Spotify.

Dependencies:
pyspotify
VLC Python bindings (Olivier Aubert)
TkInter
PyMongo
MongoDB
Mutagen

Additionally, a Spotify Premium account is needed; without one, the program will fail to start. The account details can be added directly to secrets.py where they will be imported by the program. For obvious reasons I have not uploaded my own account details, so if it is necessary I can demo the app on my own computer where the details are stored.
